Brevet time calculator.

## Overview
Brevet is a biking event. Basiccaly people will bike to try to reach certain check points during a window. The open and close times have VERY specific rules to calculate them. 
Most simply there is a table at https://rusa.org/pages/acp-brevet-control-times-calculator that gives the simplw overview of how this works.
If the last checkpoint or the finish line is less than 20% of the brevet distance then you just calculate it as if it was just the brevet
Some of the brevets have specific closing times --> those are on wikepedia so. 
Please note that when your doing the math for anything more than 200 then you have to do the math based on the time previously

my test.py is in brevets
